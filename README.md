# The_ray_tracer_challenge
**Status:** in progress

**Goal:** creating a renderer - a ray tracer in C++, which  simulates the physics of light by tracing the path of light rays around your scene. The lib must also able to be implemented on 32bit ARM microcontroller.

**Tool:** 
1. Software: Cmake, Google test framwork, GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain, CLion, Segger Ozone
2. Hardware: JLink, STM32F103Cx dev board, Nucleo-L4R5ZI dev board, generic 1.3inch IPS 240x240 LCD.
